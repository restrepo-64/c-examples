		<th>This Pok&eacute;mon is adorable and I love it, but I can't say I caught this honestly.
		I obtained this shiny <u>Mew</u> from a cheating device known as an Action Replay, allowing for players
		to get unlimited items, guaranteed KOs, and instant catches on Pok&eacutemon. Sadly I used
		this Action Replay to hack a shiny Mew to appear and I caught it willy nilly. Like I said it's still cute, and
		I don't think there is any legal way to catch this Pok&eacutemon in game anyway, so I'll keep him
		around for a while.</th>

<th><img src="images/shinylatias.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="my shiny"></th><th><img src="images/latias.png" style="transform: scaleX(-1)" height="300px" width="300px" alt="normal"></th>
		<th>This Pok&eacutemon I got in the same way that I got Mew, so not much pride goes into catching
		this one. <u>Latias</u> is very cute with its golden coloring though. I have made it a goal to catch one 
		of these babies legally so that I can have two golden jets and a heart swelled with joy at 
		saying "I found him after 20 hours of soft resetting and I love her."</th>

<th><img src="images/shinygyara.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="my shiny"></th><th><img src="images/gyara.jpg" style="transform: scaleX(-1)" height="300px" width="300px" alt="normal"></th>
		<th>This Pok&eacutemon is actually available to every trainer that play Gold/Silver or
		HeartGold/SoulSilver. Shiny <u>Gyarados</u> is an event Pok&eacutemon that you encounter in the story and it is always
		shiny. So naturally, everyone is going to have a couple of these. I only have one though that I kept.
		Maybe I'll keep more so that I can have an army of red dragons to fight with.</th>

<th><img src="images/shinyclamperl.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="my shiny"></th><th><img src="images/clamperl.png" style="transform: scaleX(-1)"height="300px" width="300px" alt="normal"></th>
		<th>I found this shiny <u>Clamperl</u> whilst travelling underwater in my Alpha Sapphire version.
		Completely random and was not looking for it, much like a lot of other Pok&eacutemon on this list.
		One day I'll figure out what to do with him. He evolves into two different monsters so decisions, decisions...</th>

		<th>Shiny <u>Rayquaza</u> was an event Pok&eacutemon that was a mystery gift, which is a online service
		where you can just hook up to the internet and get a cool Pok&eacutemon if they have a special holiday
		or new game release. I have another shiny Rayquaza that was a hacked one, but I like this one
		better, even though it was just given to me. Black looks so good on this dragon.</th>

		<th>This Pok&eacutemon was also not being looked for when stumbled upon, and is easily my favorite 
		encounter. I was playing my Alpha Sapphire game for the first time, and I went into the route thinking
		to myself, "Hmm, I really should get a flying type Pok&eacutemon for my team," and the first Pok&eacutemon
		to show up is this shiny Taillow(the pre-evolution of <u>Swellow</u>). I was so ecstatic about finding this 
		bird, I caught it and kept it on my team for a while, loving throwing him out and hearing the
		sparkles. It was my first shiny that I was able to have on my team because it was early enough in the
		game. I love love love this green dude.</th>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
<th><img src="images/shinygastly.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="my shiny"></th><th><img src="images/gastly.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="normal"></th>
		<th>This Pok&eacutemon was another surprise. I found him in my Ultra Sun game. I was actually training
		my Pok&eacutemon team up by killing <u>Gastly</u>'s specifically. Then I see this weird colored dude 
		flashing his sparkles at me and to be honest, I screeched.</th>

<th><img src="images/shinyhaunter.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="my shiny"></th><th><img src="images/haunter.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="normal"></th>
		<th>Here is my Gastly evolved into <u>Haunter</u>! I love the blue tongue.</th>

<th><img src="images/shinysmeargle.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="my shiny"></th><th><img src="images/smeargle.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="normal"></th>
		<th>I was not as excited about this Pok&eacutemon because it happened in the same game the day after I found Gastly.
		So when I saw him pop up and sparkling, I just stared at it for a second, kind of not believing it. Nonetheless,
		the red brush looks quite nice on <u>Smeargle</u>.</th>

		<th>I got this shiny <u>Gardevoir</u> in a WonderTrade, which is where you send off a Pok&eacutemon into the internet
		and get back a random Pok&eacutemon sent off by another random guy in the internet. Usually you get a lot
		of Zubats, but I got this lady, level 100, fully trained and with Pok&eacuterus, a rare condition which ups
		a Pok&eacutemon's stats and is contagious to other Pok&eacutemon, which is actually a good bug. This is my
		most recent shiny in my Alpha Sapphire.</th>

		<h2>Special Tribute: The Ones That Were Lost</h2>
		<p>These shiny Pok&eacutemon were near and dear to my heart, but sadly, through my own ignorance, were lost
		due to me resetting my game data while they were still in it. R.I.P. buddies...</p>
