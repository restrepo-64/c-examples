		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<!--FAQS including opinions and facts from probability-->
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Do I Need Anything Special to Start Shiny Hunting?</h3>
		<img src="images/garchomp.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" class="floatright">
		<p> No, you do not! You can start running in the grass with the intent of finding a shiny
		right now. All you need is a Pok&eacute;mon game and some determination. </p>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">How Long Does It Take to Find a Shiny Pok&eacutemon?</h3>
		<p> It depends on what method you use. It could take as little as a couple minutes if you're
		lucky, or you could go months like I currently am trying to soft reset for a shiny starter in
		my SoulSilver game. Patience is the main aspect here.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">In Your Opinion, What Are the Worst Shinies?</h3>
		<img src="images/tauros.png" height="300px" width="400px" class="floatleft">
		<p>There are a lot of shinies that have barely any difference from the originals. Those are the
		worst. An example being shiny Garchomp. There are also a lot of shinies that for some reason turned
		into a sickly green color. Tauros is a notable one. I don't know why they thought these were good 
		ideas to let slide after the algorithm spit them out.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">So What's So Great About Shiny Hunting? It Seems Like Too Much 
		Work To Be Worth It..</h3>
		<p>I think it's mostly about having the odds really slim or even against you, and you 
		get them despite that. It's true it is a lot of time and effort to try and get it, but it
		is really exhilerating to be just droning on after a couple hours fishing up Magikarp and then 
		out of nowhere you hear twinkling and then you see this shiny golden one and it is just really 
		exciting. Just watch this guy on YouTube. He shiny hunts on his Twitch stream and he spends
		a lot of time searching for his monsters but his reactions are priceless and genuine. (Warning:
		 contains language.)
