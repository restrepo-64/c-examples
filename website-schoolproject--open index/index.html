		<h2>Welcome to the Hobby That Takes Too Much Time and Isn't Guaranteed Success</h2>
		<img src="images/shinymeowth.jpg" class="floatleft" height="300px" weight="200px"> 
		<p>My Hobby Website is devoted to probably one of the nerdiest subjects you will ever grade.
		Nonetheless, it still is a fun activity I engage in regularly and enjoy despite its statistics.
		I have been playing Pok&eacute;mon since I was very young and have always been enamored by the little
		monsters that could fit in your pocket. As the franchise developed, I continued to buy and play the
		newer games that came out. I knew shiny Pok&eacute;mon existed, but I thought it was more of a 
		glitch in the code or a special event than something that could happen normally in the game.
		Then, while re-playing through my copy of Pok&eacute;mon SoulSilver, I stumbled upon a Meowth with
		slightly different coloring and had sparkles coming off of it. I knew then that it was not a glitch,
		and I became hooked on Shiny Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
		<p>I started searching on Google about shiny Pok&eacutemon, and found so much knowledge to pursue
		this new fascination of mine that I decided to dedicate a whole game cartridge to hunting them. 
		The contents of this site provide all the shiny Pok&eacute;mon that I have encountered and how 
		you can start your endeavor if you choose this is something you are interested in.</p>
