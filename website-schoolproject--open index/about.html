		<h2>What Even is a "Shiny"???</h2>
		<img src="images/togepi.png" height ="300px" width="400px" class="floatright" alt="the blue and red on the shell just switch places on Togepi">
		<p>A "Shiny" is a Pok&eacute;mon with a different color palette from the regular sprite or 
		model. The term "Shiny" comes from how they give off sparkles when they enter the battle.
		The difference can be great or very minute. The way that the game creators developed the color
		schemes for the Pok&eacute;mon prior to Generation 6 was throught he use of an algorithm that
		determined the change in color, resulting in a lot of normally blue Pok&eacute;mon to turn pink
		and some Pok&eacute;mon to simply switch colors like Archeops and Togepi, which can be 
		enfuriating. There are also some shiny forms that change color only slightly, leaving only the sparkles and
		 the discerning eye to determine whether the Pok&eacute;mon in question is special or not.</p>
		<p>The real thing that gets people obsessed with the shinies is the probability of it occcurring.
		The probability of encountering a shiny Pok&eacute;mon prior to Generation 6 is 1/8192.
		After 8192 encounters, you weren't guaranteed to run into a shiny either. Each encounter
		has that probability, so there is also a chance that you will never run into a shiny.
		In Generation 6, the Pok&eacute;mon developers changed the probability of encountering a shiny
		to 1/4096, making it a lot easier to encounter one. The game also included methods
		to increase your odds of encountering a shiny Pok&eacute;mon, such as horde battles and chain encounters.</p>
		<p>In Generation 2 with Gold and Silver, Shiny Pok&eacute;mon were determined by stats, so if you 
		managed to beat the seemingly impossible odds and catch or breed one, it would have very good stats and would
		thus be a very good battler to add to your team. After Generation 2 though, it was simply random
		as to whether the stats would be good or bad. But hey, at least it would look good!</p>
		<h3>So How Do You Encounter These Elusive Shinies??</h3>
		<img src="images/shinycharm.png" alt="Shiny Charm" class="floatleft" height="300px" width="300px">
		<p>I know what you're thinking: "With all the odds seemingly not in our favor, is there any way to help us out at all in
		trying to catch these cute little sparkly creatures?" Yes, there are multiple methods to increase your
		odds of encountering a shiny and reduce you probability to as low as 1/64!(Gen 2) The methods you can
		use are as follows: <br>
			<dl>
				<dt>* Shiny Charm *</dt><dd>This handy item increases your base chance of encountering a shiny
				to +2/4096 for newer games and +2/8192 for older games. This is only available
				Generation 4 and after, and you can only get this item after completing the National
				Pok&eacutedex for the game. This means you have to catch or have owned every Pok&eacutemon
				in the Pok&eacutedex already. It is worth it if you want to catch all of the
				sparkling monsters though. A Shiny Hunter must.</dd>
				<dt>* The Masuda Method *</dt><dd>this method involves breeding with a Pok&eacute;mon 
				from a different region from yours. This was named after Game Freak Director Junichi
				 Masuda, who wanted to encourage people to trade and connect with each other
				 around the world. This method increases your chances to 6/4096 in newer games
				 and 6/8192 for the older generations. Downside to this is that you will have a lot
				 of eggs to handle and hatch, but currently is the highest chances of encountering
				 a shiny.</dd>
				<dt>* Pok&eacute Radar Chaining *</dt><dd>this is probably the hardest method to implement,
				but is the quickest to encounter a shiny. It involves the use of a Pok&eacute Radar
				which, when used, will make certain patches of grass around you rustle. You
				have to use your judgement to determine if any of the patches have enough shake to 
				keep a good chain going. If there are all weak shaking grasses around you, it is 
				a lower chance of keeping the chain alive, and it may end on you. You'll know when you will
				encounter the shiny though because the grass will sparkle. Leading up to 40 encounters, 
				the chance of encountering increases dramatically. At 40 encounters you
				have the highest chance of encountering a shiny, which is 1/200! You will need a lot of repels
				for this method as running into a non radar Pok&eacutemon will kill the chain, as well as leaving
				the grassy area.</dd>
				<dt>* Chain Fishing *</dt><dd>this method is also very difficult to do, but also has high yield
				and is faster. This method includes fishing in one spot repeatedly until you encounter the 
				elusive sparkling fish. It is very easy to break the chain though. Not getting a bite, catching
				the Pok&eacutemon you encounter, and leaving or moving from the spot you are fishing at 
				can all break the chain, but you can increase your odds up to 1/100 chance if you are able to 
				keep it going.</dd>
				<dt>* Friend Safari *</dt><dd>this method uses the communication features of the Pok&eacutemon games
				 as well as the community where you get maps with patches of grass on them from friends.
				 These grass patches contain Pok&eacutemon that you can't usually encounter in the games, but 
				 they also give you an increased chance of encountering a shiny, which is about 1/500. 
				 It is a relatively easy method provided you have friends or multiple game consoles.</dd>
				<dt>* SOS *</dt><dd>this method is relatively new and the probability is spotty. SOS chaining
				can only be done in the Pok&eacutemon Sun/Ultra Sun and Moon/Ultra Moon games. SOS battles
				 are where a Pok&eacutemon can call in an ally to help him fight the trainer. The ally called
				  is usually the same type as the one calling and has higher odds for having special abilities
				  and being shiny. apparently the odds are unknown for chains between 0 and 69, but 70 to 255 
				  the probability gets rolled for three times for the called Pok&eacutemon. After 255 calls 
				  though, the calculator gets reset, so you would have to keep track of your encounters 
				  to be effective in this method.</dd>
				<dt>* DexNav *</dt><dd>this method involves using the feature in the Pok&eacutemon Alpha Sapphire 
				and Omega Ruby games. The DexNav feature allows the user to get better at searching for a certain 
				Pok&eacutemon the more times it is encountered. This is extremely useful for if you are looking
				for a specific monster to add to your collection. You have a 50% chance in the first 
				130 encounters to find a shiny. There is still a chance you won't, but it's worth it
				to find that cool looking pocket monster you've been admiring on Google Images.</dd>
				<dt>* Hordes *</dt><dd>this method is useful because it gives you 5 chances of the Pok&eacutemon
				being a shiny rather than one. This is because horde encounters enable you to encounter 5
				Pok&eacutemon at once. It still can take a while to encounter a shiny though because it is
				the same odds as normal.</dd>
				<dt>* Soft Resetting *</dt><dd>this method is probably the easiest in terms of resources
				and difficulty, but will take the longest besides just running around aimlessly in the 
				grass. This involves restarting your game before encountering an event Pok&eacutemon like a 
				legendary or a starter. The shiny calculation doesn't happen until the Pok&eacutemon is
				in your hands so you can essentially keep re-rolling for a shiny. The odds are going
				to be the same as a regular encounter though unless you have a shiny charm. Determination
				is the key here!</dd>
